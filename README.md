# Voxel Engine

## Purpose:
This project serves as a method for me learning Vulkan, CMake, Modern C++ outside of the realm of Unreal Engine and just in general leveling up my skills. It will probably end up just containing a clone of Minecraft and some render demoscenes, Maybe a raytracer if i'm feeling brave. Feel free to use it for whatever you like, just don't expect that I will maintain it. <3

Currently this project targets 2022 MSVC and WIN32.
YMMV compiling for other targets.

## How to generate project:
- Download CMake version > 3.13
- Run RegenerateProject.bat
- VoxelEngine.sln generates under /Binaries

## Special Thanks To:
- Vblanco @ vkguide - For his amazing Vulkan tutorials.
- MarkJGx - For always listening to my bullshit and mentoring me.
- Phytolizer @ The Programmer's Hangout - For helping me become mediocre at CMake.
- Anyone else who helped me out <3
